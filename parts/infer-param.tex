\section{Parametrization inference}
\resume{The second part of the translation process is to infer the Parametrization. It relies on an exhaustive enumeration of all predecessors of each gene in order to fin attractor processes. The implementation returns a possibly incomplete of all necessary parameters, given the exhaustiveness of the cooperations.} \afaire{The last step consists of the enumeration of all possible configurations, given this set of inferred parameters, and some constraints on the Parametrization.}
