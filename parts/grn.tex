\subsection{Thomas' modeling}
\resume{The Thomas' modeling is the historical and widely-used model for the study of dynamical gene systems, and takes the form of a Biological Regulatory Network. In this subsection, we present this tool by defining the Interaction Graph and the Parametrization. We also justify our extension of the latter to use interval parameters instead of integers.}

\todo{The interval semantic is more expressive: explain}
