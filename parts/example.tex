\section{Examples}\label{sec:examples}

The inference method described in this paper has been implemented as part of
\textsc{Pint}\footnote{Available at \url{http://process.hitting.free.fr}}, which gathers PH related
tools.
Our implementation mainly consists in ASP programs that are solved using Clingo\footnote{Available
at \url{http://potassco.sourceforge.net}}.
The IG and parameters inference can be performed using the command
\texttt{ph2thomas -i model.ph -{}-dot ig.dot}
where \texttt{model.ph} is the PH model in \textsc{Pint} format and \texttt{ig.dot} is an output of the inferred IG in DOT format.
The (possibly partial) inferred Parametrization will be returned on the standard output.
The admissible Parametrizations enumeration is performed when adding the \texttt{-{}-enumerate}
parameter to the command.

Applied to the example in \pref{fig:runningPH-2} where cooperativities have been defined,
our method infers the IG and parametetrization given in \pref{fig:runningBRN}.
Regarding the example in \pref{fig:runningPH-1}, the same IG is inferred, as well as for the
parametrization except for the parameters $K_{a,\{b\},\{c\}}$ and $K_{a,\{c\},\{b\}}$ which are
undefined (because of the lack of cooperativity between $b$ and $c$).
In such a case, this partial parametrization allows 36 admissible complete parametrizations, as two
parameters with 3 potential values could not be inferred.
If we constrain these latter parameters so that they contain exactly one element, we obtain only 9
admissible parametrizations.

The current implementation can successfully handle large PH models of BRNs found in the literature
such as an ERBB receptor-regulated G1/S transition model from \cite{Sahin09} which contains 20
components, and a T-cells receptor model from \cite{Klamt06} which contains 40
components\footnote{Both models are available as examples along with the \textsc{Pint} library.}.
For each models, IG and parameters inferences are performed together in less than a second on a
standard desktop computer%

%and 3.9 Gib memory, on an Ubuntu 11.10 64-bits OS}
, and the same models without cooperations
(all cooperative sorts removed, leaving only raw actions) lead to
respectively xxx??? and yyy??? admissible Parametrization with regard to the inferred parameters,
which are found in xxx??? and yyy??? seconds.

We note that the complexity of the method is exponential in the number of regulators of one
component and linear in the number of components.
% We note that despite its smaller size in term of components, the ERBB transmission model takes more time to be computed because the biggest cooperative sorts contain more processes (up to 32 processes) than in the T-cells receptor model (up to 8 processes).
