\section{Future work}
\resume{In order to gain some performance in the inference, we may consider several leads. Model reduction by cooperative sorts removal may allow to obtain good results without exhaustive search and with possibly lower complexity. Using the multiplexes semantics would allow to reduce the possible parametrizations and make the cooperations appear in the Interaction Graph. Finally, Other ways of coping with the incomplete cooperations could be found.}

\todo{Cope with cases where cooperations are incomplete}

\todo{Use the multiplexes semantics and infer them for complete cooperations to reduce the number of parameters}

\todo{Other approach: model reduction using projections}
