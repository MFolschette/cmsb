\subsection{The Process Hitting framework}
\resume{The Process Hitting is a new framework that allows to model dynamic systems with an atomistic point of view. In this subsection, we present the definitions of this modeling and mention how static analysis makes it efficient to study large systems. We finally remind the way to translate a BRN to a PH using cooperative sorts.}

\todo{Definition: Process Hitting + dynamics + formalism used after in the article}

\todo{Give a simple example (similar to GRN subsection?)}

\todo{Mention static analysis (fixed points \& reachability)}

\todo{Definition: Generalized dynamics}

\todo{Refining with cooperative sorts}
